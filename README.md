# Slide Terms of Use

This is where we plan to host the Slide Terms of Use. In the interests of transparency 
and open discussion, we'll try to maintain this repository with the most updated 
versions of our user-facing terms of service, and we encourage you to open issues or 
submit pull requests with feedback on how our terms are written and structured.

## One important note

This git repository may not represent our 'effective' terms of service in real-time
(naturally, our legal counsel must review all changes before they can be distributed
to our users). For these effective terms of service, please visit:

email, please contact our customer support team, at support@getslide.com.
